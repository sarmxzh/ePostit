# Post-It Tag

Post-It Tag is an Outlook Add-In that will allow users to create post-it summaries of important emails to help better search for information lost in email threads. It will hopefully eventually run on Outlook.com as well as Outlook.

## Running the Post-it Tag Add-in on Outlook.com and/or Outlook
To be able to use the add-in on Outlook.com and/or Outlook, you need to have an Outlook mail account.
First download this project onto your computer and open Outlook.com or Outlook.

### For Outlook.com
- Click on the Settings icon on the top right corner of your screen.
- Click on 'Manage Add-Ins'
- Go to 'My Add-ins'
- Click on 'Add a custom add-in', 'add from file', and navigate to where you downloaded the project
- Select the 'post-it-tag-manifest.xml' file

The Post-It Tag add-in should now be in your add-ins for Outlook.com. To see them, click on any message and there should be a logo, or logos (depending on how many addins you have), next to the Reply All button.
